# Scinf
An scite-based IDE form creating Inform6-based interactive fiction

Scinf includes all the necessary tools to edit, compile and run interactive fiction based on Inform 6 (not I7). You will find an ScITE version tuned to highlight Inform 6 syntax, the inform compiler, the Gargoyle interpreter, the blorb tools... and everything is launchable from the editor itself.
